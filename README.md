# Professional Portfolio Page

This is my professional portfolio website. It displays my portfolio of coding and design work, while also showcasing my skills for HTML and CSS styling, and graphic design sensibilities. There are also links to my CV and various contact methods.

### Dynamic Scaling

This page scales content and the content proportion of the screen to ideally utilize the space of various screen sizes. Additionally, the navigation bar at the top will reorganize itself into an even-rowed grid when the viewport width is narrow enough that the row must wrap.

### Parallax Scrolling

Parallax scrolling effects are a popular method of adding visual interest to a webpage's design. Parallaxing of background, midground, and foreground elements in different planes allows for a sense of depth while scrolling through the page.
